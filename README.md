## Inspiration
The economy is in crisis mode currently. Tariffs are impeding the economy, causing unpredictable behaviour in the stock market. We decided we need to know how we can better understand and predict where stocks are going to move in the future. What's the best way to do this? Look at the insiders! MTG Advisor was made for us to help manage our finances better during a time of great turmoil in the economy, in hopes of saving some money.
## What it does
MTG Advisor is your AI Parent that helps you analyze the most recently filed insider trades made by US senators.  By comparing live and historical stock data from the dates of the insider trades, MTG Advisor can cross-reference the data to create meaningful predictions and give important insights into how the specific stocks could move. MTG Advisor can also act as a general financial advisor and give you advice on how to best invest your money. 
## How we built it
MTG Advisor is built almost entirely out of React and Flask. React manages our interactive frontend while Flask handles all of our Api calls. We utilized Vite to get our template for a fast scaffolding to get to work quickly.
## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we ran into was collaboration. This is a challenge we did not expect to run into, however, we quickly realized we have no idea how to use Git to collaborate. Throughout the entire project, we struggled with this and were continually resolving errors with it. We still probably don't know how to use git.

We also encountered many problems in the backend. This was some of our first time using these new API's, and reading documentation and figuring out how they work and connect was difficult and time-consuming. It then became even harder to synchronize all the data between our 3 API's to communicate the data between them. This took most of our time.

We also struggled working with React. This was our first time building a proper project in React, so there was a lot of learning going on as we were building, and we encountered many errors while developing our frontend (especially the CSS).
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The biggest accomplishment is that our application functions! We had our concerns about whether we were going to be able to get a working project, and we did; it even looks fairly polished (which is surprising).

We are proud that we were able to work together as a team and make this functioning app. We each worked on one part of the core functionality of the site, and being able to bind it together into an app was a big accomplishment for us.
## What we learned
We learned a lot throughout this project. Our React skills improved significantly, and we became much better at creating good-looking frontends. We also learned a lot about Flask. Due to its simplicity, we are now able to use it outside of this project comfortably. 

The biggest thing we learned from this project is the importance of planning and collaboration. Throughout development, we found ourselves often referencing our plans and sketching designs on paper as a group. Our development was streamlined through our collaboration, as we helped each other debug and teach each other about the frameworks and languages as we used them. 
## What's next for MTG Advisor
MTG Advisor can still be improved significantly. Hopefully, in the future, we can improve our UI, improve our AI bot, and primarily access a larger database for insider trades. If we can get more information on the trades and more historical stock data, we could create a much better analyzer of the stocks and insider trades. The future looks bright for MTG Advisor!
